        \textbf{Undergraduate Research Program at CSHL}
    \end{center} 

\subsubsection*{What is the program?}
The Undergraduate Research Program at the Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory will be 
a great opportunity for me to explore the field of biology and gain valuable experience
in the field of research. Students learn the scientific process, technical methods and 
theoretical principles, and communicate their discoveries to other scientists. 
Approximately 20 students come to CSHL each summer, 
living and working in the exciting Laboratory environment.
%In addition to doing research in the lab, URP participants attend a series of specially
%designed workshops, seminars and collegial events.  Workshops focus on learning particular skills, 
%such as Python programming, while seminars cover research topics, responsible conduct of research, and 
%career development. At the URP Symposium at the end of each summer, students present their research to the entire CSHL community.

\subsubsection*{Why am I applying?}
  Along with the research experience, I will also get to attend a series of specially designed workshops, seminars and collegial events.
These workshops will help me learn particular skills, such as Python programming, while seminars will cover research topics, 
responsible conduct of research, and career development.
At the URP Symposium at the end of each summer, students present their research to the entire CSHL community
which will be a great opportunity to learn how to present my work in front of a large audience.

\subsubsection*{Some more details}
It is a 3 month long program and if selected, I will be assigned a mentor who will guide me through the research process, 
with a possibilty of further collaboration in the future.

A special reason for applying also happens to be the fact that the program has a diverse set of cancer biologist, a 
field I am deeply interested in. I hope to learn a lot from them.


\subsubsection*{Technical details}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The deadline for the application is 15th January, however I request you to please submit the recommendation letter by 13th January.
    \item Given that you have been my mentor for the nearly 2 semesters, I believe you are the best person to write a more personalised recommendation letter which is both invaluable and expected by the selection committee as they intend to know the lab experience of the applicant.
\end{itemize}
