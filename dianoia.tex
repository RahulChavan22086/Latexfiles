Good morning, respected judges, participants, and our enthusiastic audience! 
A warm and patriotic welcome to "Dianoia," the first edition of debate competition of pravega, the UG fest at IISc, 
unfolding on this remarkable day of 26th of January, our Republic Day.

As we gather on this momentous occasion, we not only celebrate the intellectual prowess showcased in the serene campus of IISc 
but also pay homage to the democratic ideals that bind us as a nation, as a republic. The echoes of our Constitution resonate today, 
not just in the preamble but in the spirited debates that will unfold, echoing the very essence of democracy.

If you are wondering why Dianoia, it is a Greek word that means "thinking" or "thought", and aptly
encapsulates the spirit of our journey today. It is a quest for knowledge, a celebration of diverse perspectives, 
and a tribute to the intellectual fervor that characterizes all of us here.

Before we embark on this journey, let us extend our heartfelt gratitude to our judges for taking time out of their busy schedules
to be with us today.

We are honored to have Dr. Anupama Sharma Ma'am, an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Communication and Media Studies, St. Joseph's University,
specialising in media laws and ethics. 

We are also delighted to have with us, Dr. Bitasta Das Ma'am, an author, educator, TEDx speaker, Member-State Planning Commission,for 
the state of Chattisgarh and Senior Editor at the Office of Communications, IISc.


And we also have Ullas Aparanji, a PhD student at the Department of Computer Science and Automation, IISc, who has represented IISc in competitions such as IICM,
in literary events such as story writing. He has also published a compilation of his poems titled Broken Promises.

We are also grateful to our audience for joining us today, we hope that you will enjoy the competition.

This competition was divided into two rounds. The preliminary round, which was online presented us with a plethora of ideas and opinions.
It was very impressive that all the participants were able to present their views in a concise and coherent manner.

The top 8 participants were selected for the final round, which is being held today. 
Let me breifly introduce the format of the competition.
There will be 5 rounds in total, each round will be a test of the participants' oratory skills,
logical reasoning, and ability to think on their feet. The first round will be a simple introduction round. The second round will be a parliamentary debate, 
the third round will be a group discussion, the fourth round will be an extempore, and the final round will be a moderated debate.

The rules of each round will be explained before the round begins. The participants will be judged on the basis of their performance in each round.

Eliminations will take place after the third and fourth rounds, i.e, after the group discussion 4 participants will be eliminated and after the extempore 
1 participant will be eliminated.

The final round will be an interrupted debate between the top 3 participants.

Let us now begin our journey,

the passions and dreams that drive their pursuits.

\subsubsection*{Introduction}
The second round is a parliamentary debate, where we hope to be enlightened by the participants' arguments, and the clashes of ideas that will ensue.
We will have four teams, each team will have two participants. The participants will be given a motion, and we 
expect them to present their arguments in a concise and coherent manner. The participants will be judged on the basis of their
arguments, their ability to think on their feet, and their ability to respond to questions from the judges and the audience.

The rules for the second round are as follows, we request the judges to also make a note of these rules.

The participants will be divided into 4 pairs by chits.
A coin will be tossed to decide which pair will be for the motion and which pair will be against the motion.
Then the motion will be displayed on the screen. The participants will be given 5 minutes to prepare their arguments.
Each participant will be given 1.5 minutes to present their opening statements. Then there will be a 1.5 minute rebuttal round.
After that, the judges and the audience will be given a minute to ask questions to the participants.
Then the participants will be given 1 minute each to present their concluding remarks.

Please note that the participants can use mobile phones to prepare their arguments, but they cannot use them during the debate.
The participants can also use pen and paper to take notes during the debate.

Again, we hope that the participants will adhere to the time limit. We will now invite the participants for the second round.
