\subsubsection*{1. What are the three key factors that should be considered by an
innovator or researcher or scientist when applying for a patent?
Explain with examples.}

To maimize the chances of getting a patent, an innovator or researcher or scientist should consider the following three key factors:

\subsubsection*{Novelty}
Novelty is a fundamental requirement for obtaining a patent. It ensures that the invention is genuinely new and hasn't 
been disclosed or publicly known before the filing date. This extends to any form of public use, sale, or publication, 
anywhere in the world. Conducting comprehensive prior art searches is crucial to identify existing patents, scientific 
literature, or any public disclosures related to the invention. The goal is to establish that the proposed innovation 
brings something genuinely new to the table.

For example, imagine one has developed a groundbreaking holographic display for smartphones. To meet the novelty 
requirement, one would need to search for any existing patents or publications related to holographic displays in 
smartphones. If only the search reveals no similar technologies, the invention is more likely to satisfy the novelty criterion and will be 
accepted for patenting.

\subsubsection*{Utility}
Utility is about demonstrating that the invention has a practical use and can be applied in some kind of industry (say). 
This ensures that the invention is not merely theoretical but has tangible real-world applications. The utility 
requirement is met when an invention provides a specific, credible, and substantial benefit. It addresses the 
question of why the invention matters and how it can be practically employed.

For example, suppose one has invented a new material that can be used to create stronger and lighter aircraft 
components. The utility of the invention lies in its industrial applicability, contributing to the aerospace 
industry's need for materials that enhance aircraft performance. Clearly articulating the practical uses and 
benefits of the invention enhances the utility aspect of the patent application.

\subsubsection*{Non-obviousness (Inventive step)}
Non-obviousness goes beyond mere novelty; it requires that the invention involves an inventive step not 
obvious to someone skilled in the relevant field. This criterion ensures that the innovation demonstrates 
a level of creativity or ingenuity that goes beyond what experts in the field would consider straightforward 
or expected. It's about more than just being new; it's about being innovative in a way that is not 
immediately apparent to those with expertise in the subject matter.

For instance, consider a software developer creating a new algorithm for data compression. To meet the 
non-obviousness requirement, the algorithm should involve a unique and unexpected approach that goes beyond 
standard compression techniques. Demonstrating an inventive step strengthens the patent application by 
showcasing the innovation's creative aspects.


In addition to these factors, a successful patent application should include a detailed description of the invention. 
This involves outlining the problem the invention solves, how it works, and the specific benefits it offers over 
existing technologies. The more comprehensive and well-documented the application, the better the chances of successfully obtaining a patent.


\subsubsection*{2. How should any technology or technological invention be
assessed from the point of view of a stakeholder viz. (i) Economy
or Industry (ii) User (iii) State or Govt. and (iv) Society?}


\subsubsection*{\textbf{(i)Economy or Industry}}
From the standpoint of economy or industry, it becomes important to consider factors such as 
its economic impact, market potential, innovation and research, societal implications, regulatory 
compliance, environmental sustainability, collaboration opportunities, and return on investment. 
Assessing job creation, productivity gains, global competitiveness, and ethical considerations 
provides insights into the technology's overall contribution to economic growth and societal 
well-being. Additionally, a focus on compliance with regulations, environmental sustainability, 
and fostering industry collaboration enhances the likelihood of successful adoption and positive outcomes for stakeholders.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{(ii)User}}
The user's standpoint involves prioritizing user-friendliness, functionality, 
accessibility, and overall value. Ensuring an intuitive interface, addressing specific user needs, and providing 
ample support contribute to a positive user experience. Factors like data privacy, affordability, and adaptability 
also play crucial roles in user acceptance. Regular feedback mechanisms and metrics help refine the technology 
based on user insights, fostering an ongoing cycle of improvement. Ultimately, a successful assessment considers 
not only the technological features but also the seamless integration of the technology into the user's daily 
activities, resulting in enhanced satisfaction and adoption.


\subsubsection*{\textbf{(iii)State or Govt.}}
From the government's perspective it involves evaluating its impact on public welfare, 
regulatory compliance, and economic growth. Governments prioritize technologies that contribute to national 
security, create jobs, and integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure. Additionally, considerations 
for resource efficiency, digital inclusion, and data privacy are crucial. Governments play a role in fostering 
innovation through research and development initiatives, encouraging public-private partnerships, 
and ensuring emergency preparedness. A successful assessment from the government's standpoint aligns 
the technology with broader socio-economic goals, promoting its responsible use for the benefit of the 
citizens and the country as a whole.

\subsubsection*{\textbf{(iv)Society}}
The society's standpoint involves examining its impact on inclusivity, ethics, privacy, and well-being. 
The technology should provide equitable access, respect cultural diversity, and safeguard individual privacy rights. 
Attention to physical and mental health effects, community engagement, and environmental sustainability are crucial. 
Empowering communities through skill development and ensuring accessibility for vulnerable groups contribute to positive 
societal outcomes. Transparency, accountability, and a focus on long-term societal impact build public trust. 
A successful assessment from society's perspective prioritizes the positive contributions of the technology to 
individuals and communities while mitigating potential risks or adverse effects.


\subsubsection*{3. Write an essay on your view of AI-based science and technology
regulation and policy for India in the present and coming future.}
