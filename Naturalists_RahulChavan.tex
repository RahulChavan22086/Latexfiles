\maketitle


%Send us a short write-up (100â€“200 words) talking about why you're interested in the role, how you would carry the club forward in 2024, 
%and what could have been improved from last year.
 

Along with being a devoted Biology major from now on, I also plan to prodigiously contribute to the growth of our UG Biology club.
I have been a part of the club since my first semester and always strived to be active in any and every club activity be it open day, 
talks or lab sessions. 

I want to be the convenor as I believe I have the necessary skills and experience to contribute to the activities of the club 
in a way that ensures everyone interested in Biology has a platform to learn and grow. Along with my academic pursuits, 
the club will be my top priority where I can share my fascination for Biology with my peers.

My plans for the club will subsume all that we have done in the past i.e., talks by professors and PhD students,
mock thesis defense, Pravega, open day, etc. I also plan to introduce lecture series (by fellow students),
form a journal club for the UG students, invest more time for the juniors, organize a field trip,
and develop a website for the club (where we document all our activities). My connections with my peers will be
put to good use to also ensure interdisciplinarity in the club activities.

Things that could have been improved from last year are the frequency of engagement and the number of students involved, specific
attention to juniors who need more handholding, is a major aspect that I would improve upon. 

I realise that I will be filling in fairly big shoes and I am ready to take up the challenge and 
I am confident that I will ensure my successors will have to fill in even bigger ones.
